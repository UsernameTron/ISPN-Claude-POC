- [ ] Laptop with Claude Desktop installed (for live demo if requested)
- [ ] Notes/talking points for key slides

### Key Talking Points by Slide:

**Slide 1: Opening**
"This isn't a proposal or a pilot request - Claude Desktop is already installed and working. You can test it today."

**Slide 2: What Is Claude**
"Think of it as your best analyst who knows ISPN inside and out, available 24/7. You ask questions in plain English, you get board-ready answers in minutes."

**Slides 3-7: Executive Examples**
"Notice the pattern: What currently takes hours now takes minutes. This isn't about replacing people - it's about giving our executives their time back for strategic work."

**Slide 8: How Simple**
"These are plain English questions - no technical training needed. And these are real answers with real ISPN data and context."

**Slide 9: Technology Stack**
"Here's what makes this possible: MCPs connect to our systems securely. Skills understand our business. Your data never leaves our control. That's it."

**Slide 11: Competitive Advantage**
"Your competitors are looking at this technology right now. The companies that move first will have a 12-18 month decision speed advantage."

**Slide 12: ROI**
"Let's be clear on the numbers: $28,500 investment to get back $697,000 in executive productivity. That's a 2,384% return with a two-week payback."

**Slide 13: Test Drive**
"This isn't theory. Claude Desktop is installed. Pick your role, try it with your actual work, see what happens. Five minutes."

**Slide 15: Recommendation**
"The technology is ready. The business case is exceptional. Your competitors are moving. The implementation is straightforward. This is the easiest strategic decision you'll make this year."

## Phase 5: Handling Board Questions

### Anticipated Questions & Answers:

**Q: "Is our data secure?"**
A: "Yes. Claude Desktop runs locally on ISPN machines. Data stays within our systems. We use existing permissions - if an executive can't access something, Claude can't either. Full audit trails maintained. Nothing leaves our environment."

**Q: "What if it makes a mistake?"**
A: "Claude generates outputs that executives review before distribution - same as any analyst's work. The accuracy is high, and the system learns from corrections. We also have validation checkpoints built into the 30-day pilot."

**Q: "How much does this actually cost?"**
A: "Total first-year investment is $28,500: $12,000 software, $8,500 setup, $8,000 training. Annual ongoing is about $15,000. Conservative ROI is 2,384% based on executive time value alone."

**Q: "What's the implementation risk?"**
A: "Very low. It's a 30-day phased pilot with clear go/no-go decisions at each week. If it doesn't deliver value, we stop. But based on what we've seen in testing, that's unlikely."

**Q: "Why now? Can't we wait?"**
A: "Two reasons: First, your competitors are exploring this now - delay means catching up instead of leading. Second, the ROI is immediate. Every month we wait is $58,000 in executive productivity we're not capturing."

**Q: "Can the whole organization use this?"**
A: "Yes, and that's the plan. We start with the 5-person executive team to prove value, then expand to their 10 direct reports, then broader. The unit economics improve as we scale."

**Q: "What about training? Is this complicated?"**
A: "Remarkably simple. If you can ask a question in English, you can use Claude. The 2-hour orientation in Week 1 is mostly about learning your system connections and setting preferences."

**Q: "How do we measure success?"**
A: "Four metrics: 85%+ daily executive usage, 40+ hours/week saved collectively, improved decision quality (measured by board feedback), zero security incidents. All measured in the 30-day pilot."

## Success Indicators During Presentation

### Positive Signals:
- ✅ Board members lean forward, take notes
- ✅ Questions focus on "how soon can we start" not "should we do this"
- ✅ Executives in room volunteer to test it immediately
- ✅ CFO/CEO ask about scaling economics
- ✅ Board members identify additional use cases spontaneously
- ✅ Someone asks "why aren't we already doing this?"

### Need More Work Signals:
- ⚠️ Questions focus on "what could go wrong"
- ⚠️ Skepticism about ROI numbers
- ⚠️ Concern about complexity/training
- ⚠️ Request for pilot before decision
- ⚠️ Comparison to failed past technology initiatives

### How to Handle Skepticism:
1. **Acknowledge the concern** - "That's a fair question..."
2. **Provide specific data** - "Here's what we've seen in testing..."
3. **Offer live demo** - "Let me show you right now on this laptop..."
4. **Propose low-risk step** - "What if we do a 1-week test with just the CEO..."
5. **Reference external validation** - "This is production technology from Anthropic, used by..."

## Emergency Backup Plans

**If Presentation Tech Fails:**

- Offer to email full presentation and schedule follow-up

**If Questions Get Too Technical:**
- Acknowledge: "That's getting into implementation details..."
- Redirect: "The key business question is..."
- Defer: "Let's schedule a technical deep-dive with IT after this..."
- Focus: "What matters for this decision is..."

**If Board is Skeptical:**
- Offer immediate live demo on your laptop
- Propose 1-week CEO-only test before full pilot
- Show external validation (Anthropic customers, success stories)
- Focus on low-risk nature (30-day pilot, easy exit)

**If Time Runs Short:**
- Skip to slides 11 (urgency), 12 (ROI), 15 (decision)
- Hit these key points: Ready now, $697K return, 2-week payback, competitors moving
- Offer to send full presentation and schedule individual demos

**Your job is to convey confidence, simplicity, and urgency.**

The ROI speaks for itself. The technology works. The time is now.
