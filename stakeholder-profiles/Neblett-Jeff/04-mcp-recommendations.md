# Jeff Neblett - MCP Recommendations
## Strategic Technology Integration for CEO Leadership

### Executive Summary
These Model Context Protocol (MCP) recommendations enable Jeff Neblett to directly connect Claude Desktop to ISPN's critical business systems, eliminating the friction between strategic thinking and information access. Each MCP transforms how the CEO interacts with data, people, and decisions.

---

## Priority 1: Asana Integration MCP

### Executive Problem Solved
**The Strategic Visibility Gap**: As CEO, Neblett needs instant visibility into strategic initiatives across all departments, M&A integrations, and operational projects. Currently, he relies on weekly status reports that are outdated before he reads them, or must interrupt direct reports for updates.

### Business Value
- **Strategic Alignment**: Real-time view of all strategic initiatives without waiting for reports
- **Resource Optimization**: Instantly identify resource bottlenecks across projects
- **Integration Success**: Track M&A integration milestones for iGLASS and DxTEL in real-time
- **Board Confidence**: Answer any board question about project status immediately
- **Decision Velocity**: Make resource allocation decisions with current data, not last week's snapshot

### Specific CEO Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: Monday Morning Executive Meeting Prep
**Current State**: Spends 2 hours Sunday night reviewing multiple project reports
**With Asana MCP**: 
```
"Show me all strategic initiatives behind schedule, resource constraints, and this week's critical milestones across all departments."
```
- Instant comprehensive view of organizational execution
- Identifies cross-functional dependencies
- Highlights risks before they escalate
- Time: 2 hours → 5 minutes

#### Use Case 2: Board Meeting Project Status
**Scenario**: Board member asks about DxTEL integration progress
**Without MCP**: "I'll have to get back to you after checking with the team"
**With MCP**: 
```
"What's the current status of DxTEL integration, including completed milestones, remaining tasks, and any blockers?"
```
- Immediate, detailed response with specific metrics
- Maintains CEO credibility and board confidence
- No follow-up required

#### Use Case 3: Resource Allocation Decisions
**Strategic Challenge**: Deciding between competing initiatives for Q2
**With Asana MCP**:
```
"Analyze resource allocation across our top 5 strategic initiatives. Show me where we have conflicts and what the impact would be of deprioritizing each option."
```
- Data-driven prioritization
- Clear view of trade-offs
- Optimal resource deployment

### Integration Power
**Multiplication Effect with Skills**:
- **Asana + `pptx`**: Auto-generate board slides with real project data
- **Asana + `xlsx`**: Create resource optimization models from actual utilization
- **Asana + `artifacts-builder`**: Interactive dashboards showing initiative health
- **Asana + `docx`**: Strategic reviews with embedded project metrics

**Weekly Time Savings**: 8-10 hours of status gathering eliminated

### Security Posture
- **Data Location**: All data remains within ISPN's Asana instance
- **Access Control**: CEO's existing Asana permissions apply
- **Audit Trail**: All queries logged in Asana's audit system
- **Compliance**: SOC 2 compliant, suitable for PE reporting
- **No Data Replication**: Real-time queries, no local storage

## Priority 2: Slack Integration MCP

### Executive Problem Solved
**The Communication Bottleneck**: Neblett manages complex stakeholder communications across board members, PE partners, leadership team, and 180+ employees. Critical decisions get delayed waiting for input, and strategic messages require multiple versions for different audiences.

### Business Value
- **Decision Acceleration**: Get instant input from any team member or group
- **Cultural Pulse**: Monitor organizational sentiment and engagement real-time
- **Crisis Response**: Rapid communication during critical events
- **Leadership Presence**: Maintain visibility across distributed teams

```
- Strategic consultation in hours, not days
- Documented decision process
- Asynchronous input from busy executives
- Decision made 72 hours faster

#### Use Case 2: All-Hands Strategic Communication
**After Major Announcement**: DxTEL acquisition closes
**With Slack MCP**:
```
"Create and send three targeted messages about the DxTEL acquisition: 
1. Leadership team - integration priorities and responsibilities
2. All employees - what this means for ISPN's growth
3. Tech center teams - operational implications"
```
- Consistent core message
- Audience-appropriate detail
- Instant distribution
- No communication lag

#### Use Case 3: Organizational Intelligence Gathering
**Strategic Question**: "How is the iGLASS integration being received by teams?"
**With Slack MCP**:
```
"Analyze Slack sentiment in channels mentioning iGLASS over the past 30 days. Identify concerns, successes, and suggestions from the team."
```
- Real employee sentiment, not filtered feedback
- Early warning on integration issues
- Identifies unsung successes to celebrate
- Proactive leadership response

### Integration Power

- **Slack + `internal-comms`**: Craft perfect stakeholder messages instantly
- **Slack + `docx`**: Share strategic documents directly to channels
- **Slack + `xlsx`**: Distribute financial analyses to leadership team
- **Slack + Asana**: Connect communications to project actions

**Communication Efficiency**: 5x faster stakeholder alignment

### Security Posture

- **Encryption**: All communications encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Compliance**: Supports ISPN's regulatory requirements

## Priority 3: Filesystem Access MCP

```
- Complete analysis in 3 minutes vs. 3 hours
- Catches issues CFO might miss
- Ready for strategic discussion immediately

#### Use Case 2: Due Diligence Deep Dive
**M&A Scenario**: Evaluating target company data room

```
- Process 500+ pages in minutes

- Faster deal evaluation

### Integration Power
