## Demo Flow

### Opening Hook (2 minutes)

**Facilitator**: 
"Jeff, I know Sunday board prep is your least favorite part of the job. You mentioned spending 4-6 hours every Sunday pulling together reports, and still getting caught off-guard by board questions. Today, I'm going to show you how to get better board packages in 10 minutes than what currently takes you all Sunday afternoon."

**Set the stage**:
"This is your actual Claude Desktop, connected to your real Asana projects, your Slack, and this month's financial reports. This isn't a simulation - we're going to create next Monday's board update right now, live."

**Create urgency**:
"But here's what's more interesting - imagine you just got a call about an acquisition opportunity and the board wants a special meeting tomorrow. Let's see how you'd handle that with Claude."

---

### Act 1: The Current Pain (1 minute)

**Facilitator**:
"Right now, when the board asks for an emergency acquisition review, here's your life:
1. Cancel your evening plans
2. Pull your CFO and SVP into emergency meetings
3. Spend 4 hours gathering data from 7 different systems
4. Another 3 hours building financial models
5. 2 more hours creating the presentation
6. Still missing critical integration insights
7. Present with caveats and 'I'll get back to you' moments

Total damage: 10-15 hours, stressed team, incomplete analysis, and diminished board confidence."

**Show evidence**:
[Pull up last month's board prep timeline showing actual hours spent]

---

### Act 2: The Transformation (5 minutes)

**Facilitator types this exact prompt:**

```
"I need a complete board package for an emergency acquisition discussion on TechServ Solutions (a rural broadband provider in Georgia). 

Pull our Southeast expansion strategy from Asana, analyze how this target accelerates our market entry, create a financial model with 3-year integrated projections, identify top 5 integration risks based on our iGLASS experience, and generate a 15-slide board presentation.

Also prepare my CEO talking points and anticipate the tough questions board members will ask, with data-backed answers."
```

**As Claude works, narrate the magic happening:**

[0:00-0:30] "Watch - it's connecting to Asana right now, pulling your actual Southeast expansion projects..."

[0:30-1:00] "Now it's accessing your filesystem, analyzing the iGLASS integration documents to learn from that experience..."

[1:00-1:30] "See it building the financial model - this is a real Excel file with working formulas, not just static numbers..."

[1:30-2:00] "It's creating your board deck using ISPN's actual template..."

[2:00-2:30] "Now it's even thinking through what questions your board typically asks..."

**[2:30] - First outputs appear:**

"Jeff, look at this - here's your financial model. Click into any cell - these are real Excel formulas, not just a picture."
[Open the Excel file, change an assumption, show the model recalculates]

"Here's your board presentation..."
[Click through 3-4 slides, focusing on executive summary and integration timeline]

"And these are the questions it's anticipating from your board..."
[Show the Q&A prep document]

**The reveal moment**:
"That took 2 minutes and 30 seconds. The analysis is actually deeper than what your team typically produces - look at this integration risk matrix. It learned from your iGLASS experience and applied those lessons automatically."

---

### Act 3: Make It Real (2 minutes)

**Facilitator**:
"But Jeff, you're thinking - that's a fictional company. Let's do something real. What's an actual decision you need to make this week?"

**[Wait for Jeff to suggest something, or offer:]**
"How about we prepare for Monday's executive team meeting right now?"

**Have Jeff type himself:**
```
"Show me all strategic initiatives from Asana that are behind schedule or at risk. For each one, identify the root cause, impact on Q2 goals, and recommended intervention. Create a one-page executive brief for Monday's leadership meeting."
```

**Let Jeff experience the response himself:**
- He sees his actual projects
- Real risks he wasn't aware of
- Specific recommendations he can act on
- Professional brief ready to share

"Jeff, you just did your Monday prep. It's Thursday. You're three days ahead."

---

### Closing Impact Statement (1 minute)

**Facilitator**:
"Let me put this in perspective. You currently spend:
- 4 hours every Sunday on board prep
- 3 hours weekly on executive meeting prep  
- 5 hours monthly on acquisition analysis
- 6 hours monthly on stakeholder updates

That's 70+ hours a month on information synthesis instead of strategic leadership.

With Claude Desktop, those 70 hours become 3-4 hours. You get back two full work weeks every month.

But here's what really matters: When Align Capital calls with an urgent request, when the board has a tough question, when an acquisition opportunity has a 24-hour window - you're ready. Instantly. With better analysis than your competitors can produce in a week."

## Q&A Handling (5 minutes)

### Anticipated Questions & Responses

**Q: "Is my data secure?"**
**A**: "Absolutely. Watch this..." [Show security settings]
"Your data never leaves ISPN's control. Claude connects to your systems using your existing credentials. It's like having an analyst with your exact permissions - they can only see what you can see. Every query is logged for audit trails. This meets PE-grade security requirements."

**Q: "What if it makes a mistake?"**
**A**: "Great question. Let me show you something in the Excel model..." [Open the model]
"See these formulas? You can verify every calculation. This isn't black-box AI - it's transparent analysis you can validate. Plus, you're the CEO - you review before distributing, just like you do with your CFO's work today."

**Q: "How much does this cost?"**
**A**: "The software is $200 per month. But let's be honest about the real cost discussion. Your time is worth roughly $500 per hour to ISPN. You're saving 70 hours monthly. That's $35,000 in monthly value. The ROI is 175:1. The question isn't cost - it's how fast we can deploy this."

**Q: "Can my team use this?"**
**A**: "Absolutely, and they should. Imagine Scott having this for financial analysis, Charlie for operations, Ty for sales forecasting. But here's my recommendation: You use it exclusively for two weeks first. Get comfortable, see the impact, then we roll out to your directs. Within 30 days, your entire leadership team operates at this level."

**Q: "What if I'm not technical?"**
**A**: "Jeff, you just used it yourself. Did you write any code? Configure any APIs? You had a conversation. That's the breakthrough - it works the way you think, not the way computers work."

**Q: "How long to implement?"**
**A**: "You're looking at it implemented. This is your live system. We can do a 30-minute personalization session tomorrow to tune it to your preferences, but you could use this for tomorrow's board call if needed."

## Success Signals to Watch For

### Verbal Cues
✅ "I need this immediately" or "When can I start using this?"
✅ "Can you show me how to do [specific task]?" (Already thinking of use cases)
✅ "What would it take to get my team on this?"
✅ "This would have saved me hours last week when..."

### Non-Verbal Cues
✅ Leaning forward during the demo
✅ Taking notes on use cases
✅ Asking to try it himself
✅ Pulling out phone to clear calendar for training

### Critical Success Indicator
🎯 **Jeff asks: "Can I use this for tomorrow's [specific meeting/decision]?"**
This means he's mentally committed and thinking implementation.

## Backup Plans

### If MCP Connection Fails
**Say**: "Looks like we have a connection hiccup. Let me show you what would have happened..."
**Action**: Switch to pre-recorded video of same demo
**Recovery**: "This is exactly what you'd see with a stable connection. Let's get IT to verify your setup after this."

### If Output Isn't Perfect
**Say**: "Notice how it got 95% of the way there? Watch how easy it is to refine..."
**Action**: Show a follow-up prompt that improves the output
**Point**: "Unlike your current process, refinement takes seconds, not hours."

### If Jeff Is Skeptical
**Pivot**: "You know what? Forget the demo. What's the one thing that would save you the most time this week?"
**Action**: Build solution to his exact problem live
**Close**: "That's what this does. Every day. For everything you need."

### If Time Runs Short
**Accelerate**: Skip to the real project demo (Act 3)
**Focus**: Show actual ISPN data solving real problem
**Close**: "I'll send you a video of the full capabilities, but you've seen enough to know this changes everything."

## Facilitator Notes

### Jeff's Triggers

- **Gain**: Family time, board confidence, first-mover advantage
- **Power**: Being the best-prepared CEO in the PE portfolio

### Communication Style
- Direct, no fluff - get to business value quickly
- Use financial metrics and ROI language
- Reference PE/board dynamics
- Connect to strategic themes (M&A, growth, scaling)

### Closing Psychology

## The One Thing to Remember

**This demo isn't about AI. It's about giving Jeff his Sundays back while making him the most prepared CEO in every board meeting.**

If you accomplish nothing else, make sure Jeff sees himself using this tomorrow for a real decision. Once he experiences that moment of "I could have had this answer instantly," the sale is complete.

**Demo success = Jeff asks to keep Claude Desktop open after you leave.**
