**Time Savings Value:**
- Executive time valued at $250-500/hour (Charlie: $250, Scott: $300, Jeff: $350, Bryon: $150, Ty: $200)
- Team time valued at $50-100/hour (analysts, coordinators, specialists)
- Calculated as: (Current hours - Future hours) × hourly rate × frequency

**Strategic Capacity Value:**
- Valued at 2-3x time savings (reflects better decision quality from freed capacity)
- Conservative: 2x for operational roles
- Aggressive: 3x for strategic C-suite roles

**Risk Reduction Value:**
- Probability-weighted value of prevented events
- Conservative discount: 50% (only half of risks would have materialized)
- Example: 10 initiative delays × $100K each × 50% = $500K

**Revenue Impact Value:**
- Churn prevention: Customer ARR × retention improvement × probability
- Expansion: Pipeline value × close rate improvement × probability
- Velocity: Revenue × acceleration % × probability
