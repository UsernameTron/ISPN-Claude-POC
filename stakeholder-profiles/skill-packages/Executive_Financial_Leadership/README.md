## Best Practices for Dual-Role Executives

### Time Allocation Optimization
**Before:** 70% tactical financial work / 30% strategic leadership
**After:** 10% validation / 90% strategic leadership

**Freed time should focus on:**
1. Board and shareholder relationship management
2. M&A evaluation and business development
3. Capital allocation optimization
4. Strategic planning and market positioning
5. Cross-functional operational leadership

### Validation Discipline
Even with automation, maintain executive oversight:
- **Monthly Close:** 2-hour CFO review of automated analysis
- **Board Materials:** Always review before board distribution
- **M&A Evaluation:** Validate key assumptions and scenarios
- **Compliance:** Spot-check covenant calculations quarterly

### Strategic Integration
Use freed capacity for high-value activities:
- Evaluate 5-6 M&A targets/year (vs. 2-3 currently)
- Conduct quarterly strategic planning with scenario modeling
- Build deeper board relationships (more time for 1-on-1 updates)
- Optimize capital allocation across growth initiatives
