## Portfolio Health Breakdown

### 🔴 RED - CRITICAL (3 initiatives)

**1. Southeast Network Expansion** (Priority #1)
- Owner: Charlie Brenneman
- Budget: $2.52M actual / $2.40M planned (+5%)
- Timeline: 3 weeks behind, 68% complete (target: 85%)
- Critical Issue: Engineering resource conflict between Southeast expansion and DxTEL integration
- Business Impact: $450K revenue delay to Q2
- Recommended Action: Contract hiring (2 engineers, $180K)

**2. Customer Portal Redesign** (Priority #7)
- Owner: Bryon Gaddy
- Budget: $298K actual / $340K planned (-12%, underspent due to delay)
- Timeline: 5 weeks behind, 52% complete (target: 80%)
- Critical Issue: Scope creep (40% feature expansion)
- Business Impact: $250K customer satisfaction value delayed
- Recommended Action: Scope freeze, extend timeline Q4 → Q1

**3. Financial Systems Integration** (Priority #3)
- Owner: Scott Lauber
- Budget: $612K actual / $580K planned (+5.5%)
- Timeline: 2 weeks behind, 71% complete (target: 80%)
- Critical Issue: Data migration complexity from acquisitions
- Business Impact: $227K annual value at risk
- Recommended Action: Extend to Q1, add external consulting ($45K)

### ⚠️ YELLOW - ATTENTION NEEDED (7 initiatives)

- IT Infrastructure Modernization: 1 week behind, +12% budget
- Sales Enablement Platform: On schedule, +8% budget
- Customer Success Program: 1 week behind, hiring delays
- HR Systems Upgrade: On schedule, +6% budget
- Marketing Automation: 2 weeks behind, scope issues
- Network Monitoring Upgrade: 1 week behind, acceptable
- Knowledge Base Redesign: On schedule, +7% budget

### ✅ GREEN - ON TRACK (12 initiatives)

Including:
- DxTEL Integration: 34% complete, ahead of schedule
- iGLASS Synergy Optimization: 87% complete
- Security & Compliance: 91% complete
- Employee Training: 78% complete
- [8 additional healthy initiatives]

## Resource Allocation Analysis

**Current Utilization by Function:**
- Engineering: 94% (CRITICAL - at capacity)
- Operations: 87% (manageable)
- Finance: 82% (healthy)
- Sales/Marketing: 89% (near capacity)
- IT/Technology: 91% (near capacity)

**Critical Resource Conflicts:**

1. **Engineering Team (CRITICAL)**
   - 3 senior network engineers over-allocated (120% capacity)
   - Initiatives affected: Southeast Expansion + DxTEL Integration
   - Resolution: Hire 2 contract engineers or adjust timelines

2. **Bryon Gaddy - Sales Leadership (MODERATE)**
   - Over-allocated across 3 initiatives (Portal, Enablement, Marketing)
   - Resolution: Hire Sales Operations Manager (already in pipeline)

## Dependency Map

**Critical Path Chain:**
DxTEL Integration → Financial Systems Integration → Board Reporting Automation

- DxTEL on track (ahead of schedule - buffer exists)
- Financial Systems 2 weeks behind (manageable)
- Board Reporting dependent on both (Q2 target)

**Risk:** DxTEL delay would cascade to financial and board reporting. Current status: LOW RISK (DxTEL ahead).

## Portfolio Prioritization Recommendations

**Recommended Changes for Q1 2025:**

INCREASE PRIORITY:
- Sales Enablement Platform (#9 → #6): Revenue impact, ready to execute
- Customer Success Program (#6 → #5): Customer retention critical

DECREASE PRIORITY:
- Marketing Automation (#12 → #15): Scope unclear, defer to Q2
- Knowledge Base Redesign (#13 → #16): Low impact, resource constraint

**Rationale:** Focus resources on revenue-generating and customer retention initiatives during M&A integration period.

## Executive Recommendations

**FOR CEO (Jeff Neblett):**
1. IMMEDIATE: Approve $180K contract engineering (Southeast Expansion)
2. WEEK 2: Approve $310K total portfolio budget increase
3. WEEK 3: Q1 portfolio reprioritization review

**FOR SVP OPERATIONS (Charlie Brenneman):**
1. IMMEDIATE: Resolve engineering resource conflict
2. ONGOING: Implement scope freeze policy across initiatives
3. WEEKLY: Continue portfolio health monitoring
