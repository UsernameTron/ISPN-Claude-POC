## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Generate Weekly Portfolio Dashboard

```
Create my weekly portfolio dashboard. Analyze all active strategic initiatives from Asana,
show health status for each initiative (Red/Yellow/Green), identify resource conflicts,
map critical dependencies, flag initiatives requiring executive attention, and recommend
prioritization changes. Include CEO decisions needed this week.
```

**What You'll Get:**
- Portfolio health score and executive summary
- Red/Yellow/Green status for all 22 initiatives
- Resource conflicts with resolution recommendations
- Dependencies and critical path analysis
- CEO decisions required with business impact
- Time: 5 minutes vs. 4 hours manual analysis

### Identify Resource Conflicts

```
Analyze resource allocation across our strategic initiative portfolio. Identify all resource
conflicts where team members are over-allocated, quantify business impact of each conflict,
and recommend resolution strategies (hiring, contracting, timeline adjustments).
```

### Map Initiative Dependencies

```
Create dependency map for our Q4 strategic initiatives. Show which initiatives depend on
others, identify critical path, assess schedule risk, and recommend coordination strategies
to prevent delays.
