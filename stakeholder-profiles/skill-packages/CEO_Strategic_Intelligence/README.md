## Real CEO Impact Statement

*"As CEO managing two acquisitions simultaneously while exploring a third, I was drowning in information fragmentation. Financial reports here, Asana updates there, Slack messages everywhere. My Sundays were spent synthesizing data instead of thinking strategically.*

*Claude's CEO Strategic Intelligence skill gave me something priceless: time to think. My Sunday prep went from 4 hours to 15 minutes. My board packages from 12 hours to 1 hour. But more importantly, I'm now spending 85% of my time on strategic leadership instead of 25%.*

*The ROI is absurd - we're talking 4,000%+ on a $200/month tool. But the real value is competitive advantage. I make faster, better-informed decisions than any peer CEO I know. In M&A, that speed is the difference between winning and losing deals.*

*This isn't optional technology for growth-focused CEOs. This is strategic infrastructure."*

**- Jeff Neblett, CEO, ISPN Network Services**
