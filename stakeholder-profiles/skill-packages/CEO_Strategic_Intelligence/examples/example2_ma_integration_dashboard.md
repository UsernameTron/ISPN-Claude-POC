PORTFOLIO-LEVEL INSIGHTS & BEST PRACTICES

Integration Capability Maturity Assessment: ✅ PROVEN & REPEATABLE

ISPN M&A Track Record (2 Years):
• Total Acquisitions: 2 (iGLASS Networks 2023, DxTEL 2025)
• Combined Customer Retention: 100% (94 of 94 customers retained)
• Combined Team Retention: 96% (44 of 46 employees retained)
• Integration Timeline Performance: Both ahead or on track
• Synergy Realization: $520K YTD (iGLASS) + $320K projected (DxTEL)
• Financial Returns: Both exceeding 18% IRR target (24% and 26%)
• Integration Investment: On budget for both acquisitions

Assessment: ISPN has demonstrated repeatable M&A integration capability
with world-class execution. Integration playbook mature and documented.
Organization ready for additional strategic growth.

Cross-Acquisition Patterns & Best Practices:

✅ What Works (Replicate in Future Acquisitions):

1. **Retain Acquired Leadership**
   - iGLASS: Regional GM stayed, critical for team/customer continuity
   - DxTEL: Founder/GM (Sarah Martinez) staying 3 years, invaluable
   - Lesson: Leadership continuity drives 100% retention rates

2. **Early Customer Engagement**
   - Both: CEO personal outreach within 48 hours of close
   - Both: All-customer meetings Month 1 (high attendance)
   - Both: Monthly customer communication cadence
   - Result: 100% customer retention across 94 customers

3. **Transparent Team Communication**
   - Both: Weekly integration updates to all employees
   - Both: Culture integration workshops (respect legacy values)
   - Both: Clear career development pathways communicated early
   - Result: 96% combined employee retention

4. **Systems Integration Without Service Disruption**
   - Both: Phased migration approach (not "big bang")
   - Both: Extensive testing before cutover
   - Both: Customer communication in advance of changes
   - Result: Zero service disruptions across both integrations

5. **Disciplined Financial Management**
   - Both: Integration budgets established and tracked
   - Both: Monthly synergy realization tracking
   - Both: CFO oversight and accountability
   - Result: On-budget performance, no cost overruns

6. **Proactive Integration Management**
   - Both: Weekly integration team meetings
   - Both: Exception-based CEO escalation (only when needed)
   - Both: Monthly board/investor reporting
   - Result: Ahead of schedule (DxTEL) or on track (iGLASS)

⚠️  Lessons Learned (Adjust for Future Acquisitions):

1. **Revenue Synergy Timing**
   - iGLASS Experience: Sales cycles 3 months longer than modeled
   - Adjustment: Add 25-30% buffer to revenue synergy timelines
   - DxTEL Application: Conservative revenue synergy timing (working)

2. **Cost Synergy Opportunities**
   - Both acquisitions: Cost synergies exceeded targets (120%+)
   - Insight: Systems consolidation and operational efficiency often
     underestimated in diligence models
   - Adjustment: More aggressive cost synergy targets justified

3. **Technical Due Diligence Investment**
   - DxTEL: Extensive technical diligence discovered Harper platform
     value, enabling ahead-of-schedule integration
   - iGLASS: Standard diligence, some technical surprises (manageable)
   - Adjustment: Invest 2x time/$ in technical diligence for future deals

4. **Integration Resource Allocation**
   - Current: Charlie's ops team managing both integrations at 89% capacity
   - Future: Consider dedicated integration manager for 3+ simultaneous deals
   - Timing: Not needed until 3rd acquisition, current approach working

Organizational Capacity for Additional M&A:

Current State Analysis:
• Active Integrations: 2 (iGLASS Month 13, DxTEL Month 3)
• Team Capacity: 89% (Charlie Brenneman's ops team)
• Integration Playbook: Documented and proven
• Financial Capacity: $5-8M per acquisition (balance sheet)
• Executive Bandwidth: CEO, CFO, SVP Ops available for additional deal

Capacity Assessment: ✅ READY FOR 1 ADDITIONAL ACQUISITION

Rationale:
• iGLASS nearing completion (87% done, low management overhead)
• DxTEL ahead of schedule (34% done, high confidence)
• Team capacity 89% (11% available, manageable with 1 more deal)
• Proven playbook reduces integration risk and resource needs
• Financial capacity confirmed by CFO (Scott Lauber)

Recommended Approach for Acquisition #3:
• Size: $3-5M revenue (smaller than iGLASS/DxTEL for risk management)
• Timing: Initiate Q1 2025, close Q2 2025
• Geography: Southeast priority (Georgia, South Carolina)
• Integration: Stagger with DxTEL (don't start simultaneously)
• Resources: Current team capacity sufficient

Board Recommendation: Proceed with Southeast expansion evaluation and
target engagement. Organization has demonstrated capability for 3
simultaneous integrations (iGLASS completing, DxTEL mid-stream, new
acquisition initiating). Proven playbook and strong track record support
continued M&A-driven growth strategy.

(DxTEL) demonstrates value creation discipline. Integration playbook is

• Combined: Both integrations tracking ahead or on schedule

Board Questions - Anticipated Q&A:

Q1: "Why is customer retention 100% when industry average is 85-90%?"
A: Three critical success factors: (1) CEO personal customer outreach
   within 48 hours of close builds trust, (2) Retained acquired leadership
   (Regional GM, Sarah Martinez) maintains relationship continuity, (3)
   Service level improvements (24/7 NOC) exceed customer expectations.
   Our relationship-first integration approach differentiates ISPN.

Q2: "Can ISPN manage a third acquisition while integrating iGLASS and DxTEL?"
A: Yes. iGLASS nearing completion (87%, low overhead). DxTEL ahead of
   schedule (strong momentum). Charlie's ops team at 89% capacity (11%
   available). Proven integration playbook reduces risk and resource needs.
   Recommend smaller acquisition ($3-5M revenue) in Southeast with
   staggered timing (Q2 2025 close, not simultaneous with DxTEL active
   phase). Financial capacity confirmed ($5-8M available on balance sheet).

Q3: "What's the confidence level on DxTEL projected synergies ($320K)?"
A: High confidence. Preliminary identification Month 3 (ahead of typical
   Month 6 timeline). Revenue synergies ($200K) based on 12 customers
   already expressed interest (26% of base, 75% conversion probability).
   Cost synergies ($120K) aligned with iGLASS experience and verified by
   CFO. Harper platform more valuable than expected creates upside
   potential. Formal targets will be established Month 6 with detailed
   tracking and accountability.

Q4: "How does DxTEL integration compare to iGLASS at same stage?"
A: DxTEL outperforming iGLASS at Month 3 due to organizational learning:
   • Customer retention: Both 100% (tied)
   • Team retention: DxTEL 100% vs. iGLASS 94% (better)
   • Integration pace: DxTEL 2 weeks ahead vs. iGLASS on track (faster)
   • Synergy identification: DxTEL Month 3 vs. iGLASS Month 6 (earlier)
   This demonstrates capability maturity and playbook refinement.

Q5: "What are the key risks for continued M&A strategy?"
A: Three manageable risks: (1) Target availability in Southeast market
   (mitigated by active pipeline of 3 qualified targets), (2) Integration
   resource capacity if >3 simultaneous deals (mitigated by phased approach
   and potential dedicated integration manager), (3) Market valuation
   increases due to sector consolidation (mitigated by moving quickly in
   Q1 2025). Overall risk profile: LOW for disciplined approach with
   proven playbook.

Board Authorization Recommended:
• Proceed with Southeast market expansion (3 targets identified)
• Authorize $50K due diligence budget for priority target
• Target close: Q2 2025 (6-month timeline from authorization)
• Acquisition size: $3-5M revenue, $13-18M purchase price
• Expected returns: >20% IRR (based on iGLASS/DxTEL track record)

═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## CEO Testimonial

*"This M&A integration dashboard transforms how I manage multiple acquisitions. Instead of spending 8 hours every week in status meetings and manually consolidating data from different teams, I get a complete unified view in 15 minutes.*

*What's powerful is the portfolio-level insight. I can see patterns across both acquisitions - what's working (100% customer retention!), what needs attention (DxTEL acceleration opportunity), and whether we're ready for the next deal (yes, we are).*

*The dashboard is board-ready, which means I can go directly from Monday morning review to Thursday board presentation with confidence. My PE partners at Align Capital are impressed with our integration discipline and transparency.*

*This isn't just time savings - this is strategic intelligence that enables better M&A execution and faster decision-making. In M&A, speed and visibility are competitive advantages."*
