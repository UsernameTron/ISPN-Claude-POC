Board Questions to Anticipate:

Q1: "Why is iGLASS revenue synergy at 85% while cost is at 120%?"
A: Customer expansion sales cycles 3 months longer than modeled (9 months vs. 6
   months expected). However, zero customer churn and strong pipeline ($280K
   qualified for Q1) indicate we'll catch up. Cost synergies accelerated through
   operational excellence - systems consolidation ahead of plan.

Q2: "Can ISPN handle additional M&A given two active integrations?"
A: Yes. Both integrations tracking well with 100% customer retention. Charlie's
   ops team at 89% capacity (manageable). Integration playbook proven and
   repeatable. Financial capacity confirmed by Scott - balance sheet supports
   $5-8M acquisition. Recommend proceeding with disciplined Southeast expansion.

Q3: "What's the risk profile for Southeast expansion?"
A: Lower risk than previous acquisitions. Smaller target size ($3-4M revenue vs.
   $8-12M for iGLASS/DxTEL), similar business model (rural broadband), proven
   integration process, and strong local management retention opportunity.
   Market due diligence positive - underserved segments with regulatory support.

Q4: "How sustainable is 98%+ customer retention rate?"
A: 3-year trend stable (98.1% average). Driven by 24/7 support model (key
   differentiator) and proactive network monitoring. iGLASS and DxTEL both
   achieved 100% retention post-acquisition, validating model extensibility.
   Industry average 85-90%, so ISPN has durable competitive advantage.

Q5: "What's the timeline and capital requirement for Southeast expansion?"
A: Target close Q2 2025 (6 months). Estimated purchase price $13-15M for
   priority target (4.2x EBITDA). Integration timeline 12 months to full
   synergies. Capital requirement within current facility capacity. PE support
   from Align Capital expected based on iGLASS/DxTEL success.

CEO Talking Points:
• Lead with strength: "Two successful acquisitions, both ahead of plan"
• Address iGLASS revenue: "Synergy timing adjustment, strong trajectory"
• Emphasize readiness: "Organization ready for continued strategic growth"
• Seek input: "Board perspective on Southeast expansion timing and approach"

## CEO Testimonial

*"This Sunday brief transforms my Monday. Instead of spending my entire Sunday piecing together information from 15 different places, I get a complete strategic intelligence package in 15 minutes. The brief doesn't just tell me what happened - it tells me what decisions I need to make, what my board will ask, and how to optimize my time for maximum strategic impact.*

*The ROI is obvious: 3 hours 45 minutes saved every Sunday. But the real value is strategic clarity. I start every week fully informed, strategically prepared, and focused on the decisions only I can make.*

*This isn't a nice-to-have tool. This is fundamental CEO infrastructure."*

**- Jeff Neblett, CEO, ISPN Network Services**
