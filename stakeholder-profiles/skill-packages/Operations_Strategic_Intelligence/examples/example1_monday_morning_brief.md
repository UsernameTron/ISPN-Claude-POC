# Daily Operational Intelligence Brief
**Date:** Monday, January 13, 2025 | **Prepared for:** Charlie Brenneman, SVP Operations

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Weekend operations remained stable with 99.97% network uptime. **CRITICAL:** Digital Transformation initiative now 2 weeks behind due to resource conflict with M&A Integration. Network Engineering team at 135% allocation creating immediate burnout risk. Board presentation due Friday requires 3 hours prep (auto-generated draft ready for review).

## CRITICAL ALERTS (Action Required)

### 🔴 RED: Resource Conflict - Network Engineering Team
- **Issue:** Team allocated 135% (135 hrs demand / 100 hrs capacity)
- **Impact:** Digital Transformation delayed 2 weeks; Security Enhancement blocked
- **Root Cause:** Overlapping M&A Integration (iGLASS) and Digital Transformation milestones
- **Recommended Action:** Defer Security Enhancement start by 6 weeks OR add contractor (cost: $40K for 8 weeks)
- **Decision Needed By:** Wednesday (to avoid further Digital Transformation delays)

### 🔴 RED: Budget Variance - M&A Integration (iGLASS)
- **Variance:** +12% over budget ($54K over $450K budget)
- **Driver:** Unplanned data migration complexity (legacy system integration issues)
- **Forecast:** Additional $30K overrun likely by project completion
- **Recommended Action:** Request board approval for $84K budget increase (Friday board meeting)

### 🟡 YELLOW: Customer Escalation - District 402 Implementation
- **Issue:** Implementation delayed 3 weeks; superintendent expressing frustration via Slack
- **Risk:** Reference account at risk; potential churn
- **Owner:** Implementation team working resolution plan
- **Recommended Action:** Personal call to superintendent this week (relationship preservation)

## STRATEGIC INITIATIVE PORTFOLIO HEALTH

**Portfolio Status:** 22 active initiatives | $4.2M total budget | 68% on track

### 🔴 Red Status (Immediate Attention Required)
1. **Digital Transformation** - 2 weeks behind schedule
   - Blocker: Network Engineering resource conflict
   - Budget: On track ($1.2M / $1.2M)
   - Action: Resolve resource conflict this week

2. **M&A Integration (iGLASS)** - 12% over budget
   - Timeline: On track for March 31 completion
   - Budget: $504K / $450K (+12%)
   - Action: Board approval request for budget increase

### 🟡 Yellow Status (Monitor Closely)
3. **Security Enhancement Program** - Start date at risk
   - Risk: Delayed start due to resource conflict
   - Budget: Not yet started ($0 / $600K)
   - Action: Confirm revised start date (June 1 vs April 15)

4. **Customer Implementation - District 402** - 3 weeks behind
   - Risk: Reference customer relationship at risk
   - Budget: On track
   - Action: Executive engagement required

### 🟢 Green Status (On Track)
- **15 initiatives on track** (68% of portfolio)
- Notable: Product Modernization, Go-to-Market Expansion, Operational Excellence all green

## OPERATIONAL METRICS DASHBOARD

| Metric | Current | Target | Variance | Trend (7-day) |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|---------------|
| Network Uptime | 99.97% | 99.95% | +0.02% | ↑ Improving |
| Service Availability | 99.98% | 99.99% | -0.01% | → Stable |
| Support Ticket Volume | 243 | <250 | -7 tickets | ↓ Improving |
| Critical Incidents | 1 | 0 | +1 | ↑ Monitor |
| Avg Resolution Time | 4.2 hrs | <4 hrs | +0.2 hrs | → Stable |

**Notable:** One critical incident Friday evening (fiber cut, restored in 2.3 hours). Network uptime improved week-over-week. Support ticket volume trending down (good sign).

## DEPENDENCY & RESOURCE CONFLICTS

### Critical Resource Conflicts
1. **Network Engineering Team: 135% allocated**
   - Digital Transformation: 45 hrs/week
   - M&A Integration (iGLASS): 25 hrs/week
   - Security Enhancement: 40 hrs/week (scheduled start April 15)
   - BAU Support: 25 hrs/week
   - **Impact:** All strategic initiatives at risk; team burnout imminent
   - **Resolution Options:**
     - Option A: Defer Security Enhancement to June 1 (6-week delay, zero cost)
     - Option B: Add contractor for M&A Integration ($40K, 8 weeks)
     - Option C: Hire permanent Network Engineer ($120K annual, 6-week recruiting lag)

2. **Implementation Team: 105% allocated**
   - District 402 catch-up: 30 hrs/week
   - District 515 new implementation: 25 hrs/week
   - District 220 expansion: 15 hrs/week
   - **Impact:** District 402 relationship at risk
   - **Resolution:** Prioritize District 402 (defer District 220 expansion by 2 weeks)

### Blocking Dependencies
- **Product Modernization ← M&A Integration:** Product team waiting for iGLASS data schema (due Jan 20)
- **Go-to-Market Expansion ← Product Modernization:** Sales collateral waiting for product features (no immediate risk)

## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (Operations P&L)

**January MTD (13 days):**
- Budget: $1.8M | Actual: $1.75M | Variance: -$50K (-2.8%) ✅
- Favorable variance driven by: Lower contractor spend (planned M&A contractor delayed start)
- Q1 Forecast: On track to budget

**Strategic Initiative Spend:**
- Total Budget: $4.2M across 22 initiatives
- YTD Spend: $580K (14% of annual budget - on pace)
- Variance: +$54K (iGLASS overrun offset by other underspends)

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS (Top 3 Priorities Today)

1. **URGENT (Today):** Decide on Network Engineering resource conflict resolution
   - Meet with Finance (Scott) to discuss contractor vs defer options
   - Decision needed by Wednesday to avoid cascading Digital Transformation delays
   - Recommendation: Option A (defer Security Enhancement to June 1) - zero cost, minimal strategic impact

2. **THIS WEEK:** Executive outreach to District 402 superintendent
   - Personal call to preserve relationship (reference account at risk)
   - Coordinate with Implementation team for recovery plan presentation
   - Target: Call by Wednesday, in-person visit if needed

3. **FRIDAY:** Board presentation preparation
   - Auto-generated draft ready for your review (requires ~2 hours refinement vs usual 8 hours)
   - Key topics: M&A Integration budget variance, Digital Transformation status, Q1 operations performance
   - Request: Review draft by Thursday 5 PM for any adjustments
