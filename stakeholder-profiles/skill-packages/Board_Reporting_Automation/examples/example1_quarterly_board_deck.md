KEY INSIGHTS:
• K-12 segment outperformance (+$400K vs. plan): 8 new district wins, expanded services to existing districts
• Rural broadband softness (-$200K vs. plan): Economic pressure in rural markets, competitive pricing
• Enterprise services strong (+$200K vs. plan): 3 new enterprise customers, upsell to existing base
• Technical support exceptional (+$200K vs. plan): NetPatrol security services expansion
• Net performance: +$600K vs. plan (4% favorable variance)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Scott will walk you through the detailed financial performance. The revenue story for Q1 is straightforward: we're winning in K-12, which is now our largest segment at 42% of revenue. This isn't accidental—it's the result of the strategic pivot we made 18 months ago to focus on education markets where our value proposition and service quality create differentiation. We secured 8 new K-12 districts in Q1 with an average contract value of $78K annually. Our competitive wins were against Spectrum, Comcast, and Cox—all much larger providers—because districts value our local service model and education-specific support. The rural broadband softness we're seeing is largely economic pressure in those markets plus some aggressive competitive pricing. We're monitoring this closely but remain confident in our diversified approach. Enterprise and technical support both exceeded plan, demonstrating the strength of our broader portfolio."

PROFITABILITY DRIVERS:
• Gross margin: 49.0% (vs. 49.0% plan) - maintained despite COGS pressure from revenue mix
• COGS variance: +$306K unfavorable from higher K-12 network costs (infrastructure expansion)
• OpEx discipline: -$6K favorable despite revenue over-performance (excellent operating leverage)
• EBITDA margin: 19.6% vs. 18.3% target (+130 bps) - operational efficiency gains
• Net income: $1,975K vs. $1,690K plan (+17%) - strong bottom-line performance
```

**Speaker Notes:**
> "The profitability story is even better than the revenue story. We achieved 19.6% EBITDA margin, 130 basis points above our 18.3% target and 80 basis points better than Q4. This margin expansion while growing 12% YoY demonstrates the operational leverage in our business model. Cost of goods sold came in $306K higher than plan because the K-12 segment over-performance required additional network capacity investments—this is good COGS growth supporting revenue growth. Operating expenses were essentially flat to plan despite the revenue over-performance, demonstrating excellent cost discipline and the scalability of our platform. The iGLASS acquisition integration is delivering synergies—we're running the combined operations with only 3 incremental FTEs versus the 7 we had forecasted. Bottom line net income of $1,975K was 17% ahead of plan. This is a profitable, efficiently-run business generating strong cash flow."

BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS ($K)
• Cash & Equivalents: $6,480 (vs. $5,180 end of Q4) - strong liquidity position
• Accounts Receivable: $3,920 (26.5 DSO, consistent with historical)
• Total Assets: $28,450 (vs. $27,980 Q4)
• Total Debt: $12,800 (vs. $13,125 Q4) - on schedule for deleveraging
• Shareholders' Equity: $9,420 (vs. $7,445 Q4) - equity build through earnings

KEY INSIGHTS:
• Operating cash flow: $2,475K (+18% vs. plan) - strong cash generation
• Free cash flow: $1,870K (operating cash - capex - initiatives) - healthy after all investments
• Working capital: Improved $70K vs. plan from better collections
• Debt paydown: $325K principal reduction on schedule
• Cash position: $6.5M provides strong buffer and strategic flexibility
```

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Cash flow is the lifeblood of the business, and Q1 demonstrates we're generating strong cash while investing in growth. Operating cash flow of $2.5M was 18% ahead of plan driven by the strong earnings performance and improved working capital management. We're converting earnings to cash efficiently—not just profitable on paper but generating real cash. We invested $605K in the business through capex and strategic initiatives, which was slightly below plan as some projects shifted timing to Q2. After debt service of $570K, we generated $1.3M of net cash in the quarter. Our cash position is now $6.5M, up from $5.2M at year-end, giving us excellent liquidity and strategic flexibility. We're well-positioned to fund the growth investments we'll be discussing later while continuing our systematic deleveraging. Total debt is down to $12.8M from $13.1M at year-end—we're on track to reach our target leverage ratio by year-end."

- Debt Service Coverage: Q2'24: 1.42x → Q3'24: 1.51x → Q4'24: 1.60x → Q1'25: 1.68x ↑
- Total Leverage: Q2'24: 4.12x → Q3'24: 3.95x → Q4'24: 3.78x → Q1'25: 3.65x ↓
- Trend: Consistent improvement, moving away from covenant limits

LENDER RELATIONS:
• Status: Excellent standing with lender, quarterly covenant certificates submitted on time
• Communication: Regular updates on business performance and strategic initiatives
• Covenant Waiver History: Zero covenant violations or waiver requests since inception
• Next Review: Lender annual review scheduled Q3 2025
• Credit Facility: $15M revolving credit facility with $2.2M drawn, $12.8M available capacity

KEY INSIGHTS:
• All covenants comfortably exceeded with healthy headroom
• Deleveraging trajectory on track (3.65x leverage vs. year-end target <3.5x)
• Strong cash generation supporting continued debt paydown
• No refinancing risk—facility matures December 2027 (2.7 years remaining)
• Lender confidence high based on consistent performance and proactive communication
```

**Speaker Notes:**
> "I want to spend a moment on covenant compliance because it's fundamental to our financial health and strategic flexibility. We are in full compliance with all five debt covenants with healthy headroom on every metric. Our debt service coverage ratio is 1.68x versus a requirement of 1.25x—we're generating 68% more cash than needed to service our debt. Total leverage has improved to 3.65x from 3.78x last quarter, and we're on track to reach our year-end target of below 3.5x. This deleveraging is systematic—we're generating strong operating cash flow, paying down debt on schedule, and improving our balance sheet every quarter. Our relationship with our lender is excellent. We've never had a covenant violation or needed a waiver. We communicate proactively, deliver on our commitments, and they view us as a low-risk, well-managed credit. Our facility doesn't mature until December 2027, so we have no near-term refinancing risk. From a financial risk perspective, we're in a very strong position."

FORECAST ASSUMPTIONS:
• Revenue growth: +4.1% sequential driven by K-12 new district ramp-up and Enterprise expansion
• K-12 segment: 8 new districts won in Q1 will ramp to full revenue in Q2 (+$400K incremental)
• Rural broadband: Stabilization expected (+1% growth as competitive pricing pressure moderates)
• OpEx increase: +$306K from planned technical hiring (5 FTEs) and go-to-market expansion
• EBITDA margin: 18.8% (vs. 19.6% Q1) due to planned investments—still above 18.3% annual target
• Seasonality: Q2 typically strong quarter for K-12 (summer infrastructure projects)

YEAR-END PROJECTION (Extrapolated from Q1-Q2 Performance)
• FY 2025 Revenue: $60.8M (vs. $58.2M plan, +4% favorable)
• FY 2025 EBITDA: $11.2M (18.4% margin vs. 18.3% target)
• FY 2025 Net Income: $7.6M (12.5% net margin)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Looking ahead to Q2, we're forecasting $15.4M in revenue, up 4% sequentially from Q1. This growth is driven primarily by the 8 K-12 districts we won in Q1 ramping to full revenue run-rate in Q2 as their infrastructure deployments complete. We're also seeing continued strength in Enterprise services with 3 new customers signed in Q1 coming online in Q2. Rural broadband we're forecasting conservatively at 1% growth as we believe competitive pricing pressure is stabilizing but we're not yet ready to call a full recovery. Operating expenses will increase $306K in Q2 as we execute the technical hiring plan we'll be asking you to approve today—5 FTEs to address the capacity constraint Charlie will discuss. We're also investing in go-to-market expansion to capitalize on the K-12 momentum. As a result, EBITDA margin will compress slightly to 18.8% in Q2, but this is strategic investment for growth and we'll remain above our 18.3% annual target. If we maintain this trajectory through the year, we're on track to deliver $60.8M in revenue and $11.2M in EBITDA, both ahead of plan."

SCENARIO DRIVERS & PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT:

DOWNSIDE SCENARIO (20% Probability)
Key Assumptions:
• K-12 district implementations delayed due to school budget constraints → Revenue -$400K
• Rural broadband competitive pressure worsens → Revenue -$150K
• Enterprise customer churn (1 customer loss) → Revenue -$50K
• Total revenue impact: -$600K vs. base case (-3.9%)
Management Response:
• Delay discretionary OpEx (+$250K savings)
• Defer non-critical initiative investments (+$50K savings)
• Maintain technical hiring (capacity constraint remains strategic priority)

BASE CASE SCENARIO (60% Probability)
Key Assumptions:
• K-12 districts ramp as planned (+$400K)
• Rural broadband stabilizes at +1% growth
• Enterprise pipeline converts at 35% rate (historical average)
• Operating expenses as planned (including technical hiring and go-to-market)
• This is our committed forecast and most likely outcome

UPSIDE SCENARIO (20% Probability)
Key Assumptions:
• K-12 acceleration: 3 additional district wins close in Q2 (+$500K revenue)
• Enterprise pipeline converts at 45% (above historical average) (+$150K revenue)
• Rural broadband recovers faster than expected (+$100K revenue)
• Operating leverage from higher revenue volume (+$330K EBITDA improvement)
Trigger Indicators:
• K-12 pipeline advancing faster than expected (currently tracking 10% ahead)
• Enterprise sales cycle compression (seeing shorter decision cycles)
• Rural broadband customer retention improving (95% vs. 93% historical)

MANAGEMENT VIEW:
• Base case: Most likely outcome (60% confidence)
• Downside risk: Manageable with operational levers
• Upside potential: Real but dependent on execution
• Recommended planning: Base case with downside contingencies prepared
```

**Speaker Notes:**
> "We always provide scenario analysis to the board because we want you to understand not just our forecast but the range of possible outcomes and how we think about risk. Our base case at $15.4M revenue has 60% probability—this is what we're committing to and actively managing toward. There's a 20% probability downside scenario at $14.9M if K-12 implementations delay or rural broadband deteriorates further. If that scenario materializes, we have operational levers to pull—deferring discretionary OpEx and non-critical initiatives to protect profitability. We would not compromise the technical hiring investment even in a downside case because addressing that capacity constraint is strategically critical. There's also a 20% probability upside scenario at $16.1M if we close additional K-12 districts in Q2 and the Enterprise pipeline converts above historical rates. We're actually tracking slightly ahead of base case right now—K-12 pipeline is 10% ahead of where we expected and we're seeing sales cycle compression in Enterprise. But we're not ready to commit to upside publicly. Bottom line: we're confident in our base case forecast, we have contingency plans for downside, and there's genuine upside optionality if execution continues strong."

**Title:** Q1 2025 Financial Performance - Summary & Key Takeaways

**Content:**
```
Q1 2025 FINANCIAL SUMMARY

✅ WHAT WENT WELL:
1. Revenue exceeded plan by $600K (4%) driven by K-12 segment outperformance
2. EBITDA margin reached 19.6% (vs. 18.3% target), demonstrating operational leverage
3. Operating cash flow $2.5M (+18% vs. plan) converted strong earnings to cash
4. All debt covenants exceeded with healthy headroom, deleveraging on track
5. Balance sheet strengthened: $6.5M cash, total debt reduced to $12.8M

⚠️ AREAS REQUIRING ATTENTION:
1. Rural broadband segment -4% below plan; economic and competitive pressure ongoing
2. COGS $306K above plan due to K-12 capacity expansion (necessary for growth)
3. Technical resource capacity constraint at 94% (addressed in hiring investment request)

📈 PERFORMANCE vs. ANNUAL PLAN:
• Q1 represents 25% of year → Delivered 25.4% of annual revenue target (ahead of pace)
• YTD EBITDA margin 19.6% vs. 18.3% full-year target (130 bps ahead)
• On track to exceed FY2025 plan if Q2-Q4 maintain current trajectory

🎯 Q2 STRATEGIC PRIORITIES:
1. Scale K-12 wins: Ramp 8 new districts to full revenue run-rate
2. Stabilize rural broadband: Targeted customer retention and value messaging
3. Complete iGLASS integration: Final 8% by end of Q2
4. Execute technical hiring: 5 FTEs to address capacity constraint
5. Expand go-to-market: Invest $400K in marketing and sales capacity

→ TRANSITION TO OPERATIONS: Charlie Brenneman will now walk through operational performance and the strategic initiative portfolio...
```

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Let me summarize the financial performance before turning it over to Charlie for operations. Q1 was a strong quarter financially—we exceeded revenue plan by 4%, achieved 19.6% EBITDA margin well above target, generated $2.5M in operating cash flow, and maintained full covenant compliance with healthy headroom. We're converting strong operational performance into financial results. The challenges we're monitoring are rural broadband segment softness, which is largely macro-economic, and the technical capacity constraint Charlie will address. But overall, the financial engine is running well. We're on track to exceed our FY2025 plan if we maintain this trajectory. Now let me hand it to Charlie to walk through operational performance and the strategic initiative portfolio status."

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Good morning, Board. I'm pleased to report Q1 operational performance was outstanding across every dimension. Let me start with the headline: 99.97% network uptime, the best in company history, exceeding our SLA commitment of 99.95%. What that means in practical terms is we had zero revenue-impacting outages in Q1—our customers' businesses ran without interruption. This isn't luck; it's the payoff from the infrastructure modernization initiative we've been executing over the past 18 months. Critical incidents are down to just 2 in the quarter versus 7 in Q4 of 2023—a 71% reduction year-over-year. When we did have incidents, we resolved them in 2.3 hours on average, well below our 3.1 hour target. Customer satisfaction remains exceptional at NPS 67, which is 29% above the industry benchmark of 52. Our customers consistently cite service reliability, responsive support, and proactive communication as differentiators. Support tickets are trending down as our self-service portal adoption increases—we're deflecting routine inquiries and allowing our support team to focus on complex customer needs. New customer implementations are averaging 18 days versus our 24-day target—25% faster—which is a competitive advantage in our sales process. Bottom line: operations are running at peak performance."

## SLIDE 15: STRATEGIC INITIATIVE - DIGITAL CRM (RED STATUS)
**Title:** Digital CRM Initiative - RED STATUS - Board Decision Required

**Content:**
```
INITIATIVE OVERVIEW
Initiative: Digital CRM Platform Implementation
Status: 🔴 RED - 6 weeks behind schedule, technical integration blocked
Investment: $450K total ($312K spent, 69% utilized, on budget)
Strategic Objective: Modernize customer relationship management, improve sales efficiency 15%
Original Timeline: January 2025 - May 31, 2025 (5 months)
Revised Timeline: January 2025 - July 15, 2025 (6.5 months) - 6-week delay

CURRENT STATUS - Q1 2025
Completion: 68% (vs. 85% planned at end of Q1)
Budget Performance: On budget ($312K of $450K spent)
Timeline Status: 6 weeks behind original May 31 completion date
Risk Level: HIGH - Integration blocker requires executive decision

ISSUE REQUIRING BOARD ATTENTION:

ROOT CAUSE - Technical Integration Failure:
• Vendor CRM platform API incompatible with legacy Genesys call center system
• Integration assumed standard REST API; requires custom middleware development
• Custom middleware not in original scope or budget ($85K incremental cost)
• Vendor unwilling to absorb middleware cost (contract dispute)

BUSINESS IMPACT:
• Sales Team Productivity: 15% below target due to dual-system inefficiency
  → Sales reps manually entering data into both legacy and new CRM systems
  → Est. 2 hours/day per rep wasted on duplicate data entry (8 reps × 2 hrs × $50/hr = $800/day)
• Revenue Impact: $120K Q2 revenue at risk from sales efficiency degradation
• Customer Experience: Response time metrics declining (18 mins vs. 12 min target)
• Strategic Risk: Delayed CRM implementation postpones planned Enterprise expansion

MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Vendor Escalation: Escalated to vendor VP level, negotiations ongoing (3 weeks)
2. Engineering Allocation: Assigned 2 FTEs to custom middleware development (4-week timeline)
3. Alternative Vendor Analysis: Evaluated alternative CRM vendor (migration cost: $200K, 12-week delay)
4. Executive Steering Committee: Weekly oversight meetings established

DECISION OPTIONS FOR BOARD:

OPTION 1 (RECOMMENDED): Authorize $85K Middleware Investment
• Cost: $85K incremental (19% over original $450K budget)
• Timeline: 4 weeks to complete middleware, July 15 go-live (6-week delay from original)
• Risk: Low - Engineering confident in 4-week delivery
• Benefit: Preserves vendor relationship, minimizes delay, enables Q3 sales efficiency gains
• Total Project Cost: $535K

OPTION 2: Force Vendor to Absorb Cost (Contract Dispute)
• Cost: $0 incremental if vendor agrees
• Timeline: Unknown - legal negotiations could take 8-12 weeks minimum
• Risk: HIGH - vendor relationship damaged, could result in vendor withdrawal
• Downside: If vendor withdraws, forced into Option 3 (alternative vendor migration)

OPTION 3: Migrate to Alternative CRM Vendor
• Cost: $200K migration cost (alternative vendor platform + data migration)
• Timeline: 12-week migration = Sept 30 completion (18-week total delay)
• Risk: VERY HIGH - abandons $312K already invested, 18-week delay unacceptable
• Impact: Q2-Q3 sales targets jeopardized, Enterprise expansion delayed to Q4

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATION:
→ APPROVE OPTION 1: Authorize $85K middleware investment
→ Rationale: Cost is manageable ($85K = 19% budget overrun), 4-week delay acceptable,
   alternative options introduce unacceptable delay (18 weeks) and risk
→ Expected Outcome: July 15 go-live, sales efficiency gains realized Q3, ROI still positive

BOARD DECISION REQUESTED:
Approve $85K incremental investment for custom middleware development,
revised project budget $535K (vs. $450K original), revised completion July 15, 2025.

TIMELINE FOR DECISION: April 30, 2025 (5 days from board meeting)
→ If approved: Engineering begins middleware development May 1, 4-week delivery
→ If not approved: Management pursues Option 2 or 3 (significant delay and risk)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
> "Board, I need to bring a RED-status initiative to your attention and request a decision today. The Digital CRM initiative is 6 weeks behind schedule due to an unforeseen technical integration issue. Here's what happened: the vendor CRM platform's API is incompatible with our legacy Genesys call center system. We assumed standard API integration would work; it doesn't. Building custom middleware to bridge the systems will cost an additional $85K—a 19% overrun on the original $450K budget. We've been negotiating with the vendor for 3 weeks to get them to absorb this cost. They're refusing, claiming our legacy system is the issue, not their platform. This is having real business impact right now. Our sales team is operating at 85% efficiency because they're manually entering data into both systems—wasting 2 hours per rep per day. We're seeing Q2 revenue at risk of $120K if this continues. I've evaluated three options. Option 1, which I'm recommending: authorize the $85K middleware investment. Our engineering team can build it in 4 weeks, we go live July 15, and we preserve the vendor relationship. Option 2: continue negotiating with the vendor, but that could take 8-12 weeks and damages the relationship. Option 3: migrate to a different CRM vendor entirely, which would cost $200K and cause an 18-week delay—completely unacceptable given we've already invested $312K. My recommendation is Option 1. The $85K cost is manageable. The 6-week delay is not ideal but acceptable. And most importantly, we get this done and move forward. I need your approval to authorize the $85K incremental investment and revised $535K project budget. Can I get board approval to proceed?"

## SLIDE 35: APPENDIX - Q&A PREPARATION

**Anticipated Board Questions & Prepared Responses:**

**Q1: "What gives you confidence in the K-12 growth trajectory continuing?"**
A: Three factors: (1) We have 12 additional districts in active pipeline at 41% conversion (vs. 32% historical), implying 5 more wins in Q2; (2) Our competitive win rate vs. incumbents is 62%, demonstrating value proposition resonance; (3) School budgets for technology are increasing as ESSER funds wind down and districts shift to operational budgets for connectivity—we're well-positioned for this transition.

**Q2: "How are you planning to address the technical capacity constraint at 94%?"**
A: We're requesting approval today for 5 FTE technical hires ($450K annual cost). These are senior network engineers and technical architects. We have candidates identified and can onboard within 4-6 weeks. This will bring capacity utilization to 82%, providing healthy buffer for growth and reducing burnout risk on existing team.

**Q3: "What's your plan if rural broadband continues to deteriorate?"**
A: We're monitoring closely but not panicking. Rural broadband is 32% of revenue, down from 38% two years ago—we've been systematically diversifying. If it deteriorates further, we have three levers: (1) Targeted customer retention programs focusing on highest-value customers; (2) Product bundling to increase ARPU and improve unit economics; (3) Strategic cost reduction in rural support infrastructure if revenue doesn't stabilize. But our base case is stabilization at current levels.

**Q4: "Why should we invest $800K in go-to-market expansion now?"**
A: Because we have momentum in K-12 that we need to capitalize on. The $800K breaks down to: $400K in marketing (trade shows, content, lead generation), $250K in sales capacity (2 additional sales reps), $150K in sales enablement tools. Expected ROI is 3.2x in 12 months based on current pipeline conversion rates. If we don't invest now, we risk losing competitive wins to Spectrum and Comcast who are aggressively pursuing this market. This is a "strike while the iron is hot" investment.

**Q5: "What keeps you up at night from a risk perspective?"**
A: Three things: (1) Technical capacity—we're at 94% which is too close to constraint, hence the hiring request; (2) Competitive pricing pressure—if incumbents decide to price irrationally low, we could face margin pressure; (3) Economic uncertainty—if a recession impacts school and rural budgets, we could see spending deferrals. But we have mitigation plans for all three risks and our diversified business model provides resilience.
