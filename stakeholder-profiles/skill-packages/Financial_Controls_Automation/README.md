- Preparer and reviewer

**Reconciliation Body:**
```
Beginning Balance (from prior month)    $XXX,XXX
+ Current Period Activity                $XXX,XXX
= Calculated Ending Balance              $XXX,XXX

GL Ending Balance                        $XXX,XXX
Difference (should be $0)                $      0
```

**Reconciling Items Section:**
| Description | Amount | Date | Age (days) | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|------|------------|--------|-------|
| Item 1      | $X,XXX | MM/DD | XX days   | Open   | ...   |

**Controller Approval:**
- Reviewed by: [Name]
- Date: [Date]
- Approval: [Approved / Pending / Rework Required]

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Complete Month-End Close (T-Day to T+4)

```
Request: "Verify trial balance for March 2024. Check mathematical accuracy and flag
any unusual account balances."

Result: Trial balance verification report with anomaly alerts
```

**T+1 (Reconciliation Submission):**
```
Request: "Analyze all reconciliations for March 2024 (AR, AP, Cash, Debt, Accruals).
Identify exceptions and create Asana tasks for follow-up."

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Reconciliation analysis shows formula errors

**Solution:**
1. Open reconciliation spreadsheet
2. Check formula in "Calculated Ending Balance" cell
3. Verify formula: `=Beginning_Balance + Current_Activity`
4. Ensure all cell references are correct
5. Re-run analysis after correction

---

### Issue: Consolidation verification shows uneliminated intercompany balance

**Solution:**
1. Review consolidation master schedule
2. Identify which BU has uneliminated intercompany item
3. Verify corresponding entry exists in other BU
4. Add missing elimination entry
5. Re-run consolidation analysis

---

### Issue: Asana exception tasks not being created

**Solution:**
1. Verify Asana MCP connection: Ask Claude "Can you access my Asana projects?"
2. Confirm close project exists and you have access
3. Check project permissions (must have task creation rights)
4. Re-run analysis with explicit Asana task creation request

---

### Issue: Missing reconciliation data in analysis

**Solution:**
1. Verify reconciliation file exists in Filesystem MCP
2. Check file naming convention matches expected format
3. Ensure file is in correct folder structure
4. Confirm file is Excel format (.xlsx)
5. Verify reconciliation uses standard template structure

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Standardize Templates
Use consistent reconciliation templates across all accounts for reliable analysis.

### 2. Daily Analysis
Run daily close analysis rather than waiting for week-end batch review.

### 3. Exception Task Creation
Always request Asana task creation for exceptions to ensure accountability.

### 4. Documentation Throughout Close
Generate audit documentation continuously rather than post-close compilation.

### 5. Controller Review Required
Claude assists with verification, but Controller approval remains required.

### 6. Continuous Improvement
Refine exception thresholds and materiality levels based on experience.
