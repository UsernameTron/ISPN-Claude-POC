# Operations Executive Intelligence

## Overview

Advanced operational intelligence framework designed for Senior Vice Presidents and executive leaders managing 15-25 strategic initiatives, cross-functional alignment, and board-level operational reporting. Transforms fragmented operational data into executive-ready insights, reducing manual synthesis time by 95% while enabling real-time strategic decision-making.

**Primary Use:** Executive operational oversight, strategic initiative portfolio management, cross-functional coordination, board reporting automation  
**Key Value:** Reduces operational admin from 40 hours/week to 8 hours/week, freeing 32 hours for strategic leadership  
**Annual Impact:** 1,600+ hours saved × $300/hour (SVP rate) = $480,000+ annual value creation

## When to Use This Skill

Use for:
- Strategic initiative portfolio health monitoring and reporting
- Cross-functional operational dashboard creation
- Board-level operational review preparation
- Resource allocation and capacity planning across initiatives
- Executive team operational sync preparation
- Crisis response and operational exception management
- Annual/quarterly operational planning synthesis

**Typical Request:** "Generate comprehensive operational dashboard showing initiative portfolio health, resource utilization, cross-functional bottlenecks, and board-ready executive summary from current Asana project data."

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Initiative Portfolio Intelligence

**What Claude Analyzes:**
- Initiative health across 15-25 concurrent strategic programs
- Resource allocation and utilization by initiative and department
- Milestone achievement rates and timeline adherence
- Cross-initiative dependencies and conflict identification
- ROI tracking and strategic value realization
- Risk assessment and mitigation status across portfolio

**Strategic Synthesis:**
- Portfolio health scoring (Red/Yellow/Green status with quantified metrics)
- Resource conflict identification and rebalancing recommendations
- Initiative prioritization based on strategic value and completion probability
- Executive escalation alerts for initiatives requiring immediate attention

**Sample Output:**
```
STRATEGIC INITIATIVE PORTFOLIO STATUS - Q4 2024

PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW:
• 23 Active Initiatives: 17 Green (74%), 4 Yellow (17%), 2 Red (9%)
• Portfolio ROI: $2.3M committed, $1.8M realized (78% achievement)
• Resource Utilization: 89% capacity (WARNING: Over-allocated in Engineering)

EXECUTIVE ATTENTION REQUIRED:
[RED] Digital Transformation Initiative - $450K investment
  • Status: 6 weeks behind schedule, budget 15% over
  • Root Cause: Cross-functional alignment failure (Sales-Engineering)
  • Recommended Action: Executive steering committee intervention
  • Business Impact: Q1 revenue target at risk ($200K)

[RED] Customer Experience Platform - $320K investment
  • Status: Technical integration blocked, vendor escalation needed
  • Root Cause: Legacy system compatibility issues
  • Recommended Action: CEO-level vendor negotiation
  • Business Impact: Customer retention metrics declining

RESOURCE REBALANCING NEEDED:
• Engineering: 112% allocated (12% over-capacity)
• Marketing: 67% allocated (33% available capacity)
• Recommendation: Shift 2 FTE from Marketing to Engineering for Q1
• Alternative: Delay lower-priority initiatives by 6 weeks

```

### With Filesystem MCP
```
Read: /Operations/Board-Reports/, /Operations/KPI-Data/, /Operations/Historical-Analysis/
Write: /Operations/Generated-Reports/[Date]/, /Operations/Executive-Dashboards/
Archive: Historical operational intelligence for trend analysis

XLSX: Resource utilization models, financial analysis, capacity planning
PPTX: Board presentations, executive team reviews, initiative status updates
```

## Best Practices

1. **Daily Operational Pulse**: Run basic portfolio health check every Monday morning to identify emerging issues early.

2. **Weekly Executive Prep**: Generate executive team sync materials every Friday with upcoming week priorities and decision items.

3. **Monthly Board Preparation**: Create board operational review materials first Monday of each month, allowing time for executive review and refinement.

4. **Quarterly Portfolio Review**: Conduct comprehensive initiative portfolio optimization quarterly, including resource rebalancing and strategic prioritization.

5. **Exception-Based Management**: Configure alerts for initiatives falling below performance thresholds (timeline, budget, resource utilization).

## Common Questions

**Q: How does Claude identify which initiatives require executive escalation?**  
A: Claude applies escalation criteria based on: (1) Timeline delays >2 weeks, (2) Budget overruns >10%, (3) Resource conflicts affecting multiple initiatives, (4) Cross-functional bottlenecks requiring executive authority, (5) Strategic value at risk >$100K.

**Q: Can Claude analyze initiatives across different Asana workspaces?**  
A: Yes, Claude can aggregate data from multiple Asana workspaces if MCP access is configured. Best practice is to maintain consistent project naming and status conventions across workspaces.

**Q: What if operational data exists outside Asana?**  
A: Claude can incorporate data from files stored in Filesystem MCP locations. Upload CSV/XLSX files to designated folders (e.g., `/Operations/External-Data/`) and Claude will integrate during analysis.

**Q: How does Claude handle confidential or sensitive operational data?**  
A: All processing occurs locally through MCP connections. No data is transmitted externally. Executive dashboards can be generated with different sensitivity levels (board-appropriate vs. internal team details).

## Technical Requirements

### Asana Project Structure
- Strategic initiatives organized in dedicated Asana projects
- Consistent naming convention: "STRAT-[InitiativeName]-[Year]"
- Standard task categories: Milestones, Dependencies, Resources, Risks
- Resource allocation tracked in custom fields or task assignments
- Timeline and budget data maintained in project templates

### Filesystem Organization
```

  /Board-Reports/
    /[Year]/
      /Q[N]-Operational-Review.pptx
      /Monthly-Dashboards/
  /KPI-Data/
    /[Year]/
      /[Month]-operational-metrics.xlsx
  /Generated-Reports/
    /Executive-Dashboards/[Date]/
    /Portfolio-Analysis/[Date]/
```

### Data Quality Requirements
- Initiative data updated weekly minimum
- Resource allocation data refreshed monthly
- Financial data (budgets, actuals) integrated monthly
- Cross-functional dependency mapping maintained in Asana relationships

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Executive Prep Time | <8 hours/week | Time from analysis request to executive-ready output |
| Initiative Portfolio Visibility | 100% | All strategic initiatives included in automated analysis |
| Resource Conflict Early Warning | 30 days advance notice | Identification of resource allocation conflicts |
| Board Prep Efficiency | 90% time reduction | Board material prep time vs. manual process |
| Decision Velocity | 50% improvement | Time from issue identification to executive decision |

## Implementation Notes

### First-Time Setup:
1. Configure Asana MCP access to strategic initiative workspaces
2. Establish Filesystem MCP directory structure for operational data
3. Create initial operational KPI baseline with current initiative portfolio
4. Test basic portfolio health analysis with current data
5. Refine escalation criteria and reporting preferences

### Scaling Considerations:
- Can handle 15-25 concurrent initiatives efficiently
- Supports multiple business units with separate Asana workspaces
- Scales to enterprise organizations with 100+ strategic initiatives
- Requires standardized data practices for optimal accuracy

### Continuous Improvement:
- Weekly refinement of escalation criteria based on executive feedback
- Monthly optimization of resource allocation algorithms
- Quarterly review of operational intelligence accuracy vs. actual outcomes
