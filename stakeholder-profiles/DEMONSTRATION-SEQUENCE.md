# ISPN Leadership - Demonstration Sequence & Rollout Strategy

---

## Recommended Demonstration Order

### Phase 1: Week 1 - CEO (Jeff Neblett) - INITIAL PROOF OF CONCEPT

**Why First:**
- Highest visibility stakeholder; CEO approval unlocks organizational commitment
- Simplest, most compelling use case (board materials = universally understood pain)
- CEO success signals credibility to other executives
- Board meeting cycle creates natural urgency and measurable milestone
- CEO testimonial becomes most powerful recruitment tool for other executives

**Demonstration Approach:**
- **Setting**: CEO's office; private; no interruptions
- **Duration**: 20 minutes (15 min demo + 5 min Q&A)
- **Key Deliverable**: Board brief for actual upcoming board meeting
- **Success Signal**: CEO completes in Claude Desktop what normally takes 4-6 hours

**The Demo:**
```
9:45 AM Monday - CEO opens Claude Desktop
"I need a board-ready analysis of our H2 strategic initiatives. 
Pull data from Asana, latest financial metrics, and current initiatives. 
Flag risks and highlight top 3 recommendations. Create a presentation 
and one-page executive summary. I need this for board prep by 10:30 AM."

9:52 AM - Claude delivers:
✅ Real-time initiative status from Asana
✅ Risk identification and mitigation recommendations
✅ Board-ready presentation (editable in Canva/PowerPoint)
✅ One-page executive brief
✅ Supporting data visualizations

CEO review: "This is exactly what I need. How quickly can we get this for other uses?"
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ CEO saves 4+ hours on board prep
- ✅ CEO requests immediate expansion to CFO
- ✅ Board materials quality improved (comprehensive + visually professional)
- ✅ CEO becomes champion: "This changes how we operate"

**Dependent MCPs/Skills:**
- Asana MCP (connects to strategic initiatives)
- Filesystem MCP (accesses financial data)
- pptx-advanced Skill (board presentation creation)
- xlsx-advanced Skill (data analysis and modeling)
- artifacts-builder Skill (interactive executive dashboard if needed)

**Contingency Plans:**
- If Asana MCP fails: Use pre-populated test data; say "Live version would pull real-time Asana data"
- If presentation quality isn't perfect: "You can refine in one more prompt"
- If CEO skeptical: "Let's use your actual board meeting prep right now"

## Demonstration Dependencies & Sequencing Rationale

### Dependency Map

```
WEEK 1:
CEO (Jeff Neblett) ← Starting point; validates business case
    ↓ (CEO approval unlocks resources)

WEEK 2 (Parallel):
CFO (Scott Lauber) ← Budget holder; controls funding
    ↓
SVP Operations (Charlie Brenneman) ← Validates cross-functional value
    ↓ (CFO + SVP alignment signals "this is infrastructure")

WEEK 3 (Parallel):
VP Sales (Ty Sorensen) ← Validates revenue operations value
    ↓
Controller (Bryon Gaddy) ← Validates financial operations value
    ↓ (All 5 executives aligned: Full organizational commitment)
```

### Why This Sequence

**CEO First (Week 1):**
- Highest credibility amplifier
- Simplest success path (board materials = obvious pain point)
- Fastest demonstration (CEO saves 4 hours immediately)
- CEO testimonial most persuasive for other executives

**CFO + SVP Second (Week 2):**
- CFO = budget control; CFO buy-in funds full program
- CFO + CEO alignment = organizational commitment signal
- SVP = validates beyond C-suite benefits to operations
- Running in parallel = faster full deployment

**VP Sales + Controller Third (Week 3):**
- By Week 3, early wins create demand
- VP Sales = validates revenue organization value
- Controller = validates finance operations value
- All 5 engaged by end of Week 3; ready for full rollout

### Parallel vs. Sequential

**Why NOT Sequential (CEO → CFO → SVP → VP Sales → Controller)?**
- Sequential = 5 weeks to full engagement
- Sequential = competitors could move in interim
- Sequential = momentum loss between demos
- Sequential = Later executives ("why wasn't this available sooner?")

**Why Parallel Weeks 2-3?**
- Week 2 parallel (CFO + SVP) = faster alignment signal
- Week 3 parallel (VP Sales + Controller) = comprehensive coverage by day 15
- All 5 leaders engaged in 14 days (faster organizational adoption)
- Momentum builds throughout Week 2-3 as executives talk

- All-hands message: "Leadership team is deploying AI decision platform"
- Frames as organizational capability, not tech experiment

**Monday Week 4:**
- Board presentation: "30-day results: 55 hours/week reclaimed, $697K annual value"
- Secures scaling investment

### Internal Champion Activation

## Risk Mitigation: What Could Go Wrong

### Risk: MCP Connection Failure During Demo
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation 1**: Test live demos 30 minutes before each demonstration
- **Mitigation 2**: Have screenshots/video backup ready
- **Mitigation 3**: Pre-generate sample outputs as fallback
- **Contingency**: "The live version would pull from Asana right now; here's what it shows..."

### Risk: Executive Unavailable During Week (Urgent Business)
**Probability:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation**: Offer 3-4 time slots per executive
- **Mitigation**: Schedule weeks in advance
- **Contingency**: VP level can fill in for exec review (with CEO present)

### Risk: Output Quality Doesn't Impress
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation**: Use real executive pain-point data (not generic test data)
- **Mitigation**: Pre-test every demo with actual executive's use case
- **Contingency**: "Let me refine this with one more prompt" (add CEO input)

### Risk: Competing Executive Priority (Board Meeting, Crisis)
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** Very High
- **Mitigation**: Build 1-week buffer in schedule
- **Mitigation**: Have backup weeks identified
- **Contingency**: Accelerate to following executive if slot missed

### Risk: CFO or SVP Lacks Enthusiastic Buy-In
**Probability:** Low | **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation**: Include peer (CEO) perspective: "See what this enabled for Jeff"
- **Mitigation**: Offer extended trial period
- **Contingency**: Move to VP Sales demo to build organizational momentum
