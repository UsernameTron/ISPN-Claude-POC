# Sorensen Use Case: Claude-Powered Revenue Operations & Customer Success Intelligence

**Executive Title:** Unlocking $600K-1M Annual Revenue Impact Through Intelligent Sales Pipeline, Customer Health, and Marketing Content Operations

---

## I. Executive Overview

### The Challenge
Ty Sorensen, VP Sales/Marketing/Customer Success, leads three mission-critical functions:
- **Sales**: $5-10M annual pipeline responsibility; board-level forecast accuracy requirements (currently ±15-20% variance)
- **Marketing**: Demand generation, brand positioning, campaign execution (currently 3-4 week cycle time)
- **Customer Success**: $1M+ customer base; 12% annual churn; expansion revenue opportunity underutilized

**The Bottleneck:** Manual data analysis, content creation, and reporting consume 25-30 hours/week across Sorensen's extended team (sales managers, marketing manager, CS leaders), creating delays in decision-making, reactive vs. proactive strategies, and missed revenue opportunities.

### The Opportunity
Claude, combined with Canva and HubSpot MCPs, transforms Sorensen's operations from reactive to predictive:
- Reduce sales forecast variance from ±15-20% to ±5-10%
- Accelerate marketing velocity from 10-15 pieces/month to 50-75 pieces/month
- Improve churn identification from reactive to 1-2 months proactive
- Increase sales rep conversion rates 5-10% through intelligent deal coaching
- Enable 1 CSM to manage 40-50 accounts vs. 25-30 through health automation

**Projected Annual Impact:** $600K-1M in incremental revenue + 60-70% time efficiency gains

## II. Detailed Use Case Narrative: Monthly Revenue Operations Cycle

### Month 1: Forecast Accuracy & Pipeline Intelligence

#### Scenario: Monthly Sales Leadership Meetings (1st Friday)
**Today's Reality** (3 hours for Sorensen's time + 8 hours team prep):
- Sales admin consolidates CRM data from HubSpot (manually reviewing 120+ deals)
- Sales manager sheets calculate pipeline with simple stage-weighting (50% weight for each stage)
- Sorting through deal notes for risk flags, coaching opportunities
- Results: Forecast variance ±18%, missing early warning signals on 5-6 deals that will slip

**With Claude + HubSpot MCP** (15 minutes for Sorensen's time + 30 minutes prep):
1. **Friday 7am**: Claude runs overnight analysis
   - Pulls 120+ active deals from HubSpot (stage, close date, sales rep, activity, decision-maker engagement)
   - Applies probability weighting by rep's historical close rates per stage (e.g., Rep A: 60% Stage 2→3 conversion rate vs. 45% peer average)
   - Analyzes deal velocity (Deal X in Stage 3 for 8 weeks vs. 5-week average → flag as at-risk)
   - Flags competitive/risk factors extracted from deal notes
   - Correlates sales activity (calls, meetings, proposals) with stage progression patterns

2. **Friday 8am**: Sorensen receives executive summary
   - **Probabilistic Forecast**: $3.2M (vs. $3.8M face-value pipeline) with ±8% confidence band
   - **Risk Dashboard**: 7 deals flagged as at-risk (velocity/activity misalignment)
   - **Coaching Recommendations**: 15 deals with suggested next actions (e.g., "Deal Y: Rep needs to schedule decision-maker meeting; similar deals won after stakeholder alignment")
   - **Rep Performance**: Rep A on track 120% of target; Rep B underperforming, needs focus on Stage 3 velocity

3. **Friday 10am**: Sales leadership meeting (now 45 minutes vs. 90 minutes)
   - Focuses on strategy vs. data consolidation
   - Discusses coaching interventions on 7 at-risk deals
   - Identifies best practices to share from top performers
   - Agrees on action items for deal coaching this week

4. **Friday 2pm**: Sorensen sends deal coaching notes to sales managers, assigned reps
   - "Deal X: You're at 6 weeks in Stage 3 (peer avg 5 weeks). Recommendation: Schedule decision-maker alignment call by Monday. Use template from playbook (attached) - similar deal closed last month with this approach"

#### Monthly Outcome
- **Forecast Accuracy**: Actual close: $3.1M (vs. forecasted $3.2M with ±8% band = within forecast)
- **Board Confidence**: Sorensen presents ±8% confidence forecast; board trusts forecast and commits resources accordingly
- **Deal Recovery**: 2 deals at-risk due to low activity → coaching intervention → acceleration → closed on time
- **Revenue Impact**: Prevented 2-week slippage on $400K in deals = **$200K in Q-over-Q consistency**

---

### Month 2: Customer Health & Expansion Revenue

#### Scenario: Proactive Churn Prevention & Expansion (Mid-Month)
**Today's Reality** (CSM team spends 8-10 hours/week on manual account analysis):
- CSMs manually review customer usage patterns, support tickets, calculating "health"
- Churn surprises: Customer A announces non-renewal 2 weeks before expiration → scramble to recover
- Expansion missed: Customer B using 60% of licensed features, showing strong growth trajectory; expansion opportunity not identified

**With Claude + HubSpot MCP** (5 minutes for CSM consumption; 1 hour weekly Claude analysis):
1. **Monday 8am**: Claude runs overnight customer health analysis
   - Pulls customer data: product usage (logins, features, % license capacity), support tickets (volume, sentiment, resolution), CSM notes, renewal timeline
   - Calculates health scores (1-10):
     - Customer A: 3/10 (usage declining 20% MoM, support tickets increasing, CSM notes: "customer quiet in last 2 weeks")
     - Customer B: 8/10 (usage strong, steady growth, positive support interactions, CSM notes: "customer enthusiasm high")
   - Forecasts churn probability:
     - Customer A: 80% churn probability
     - Customer B: 5% churn probability; 60% expansion probability (new department adoption opportunity)

2. **Monday 9am**: Critical alerts to Slack
   - CS Manager: "🚨 CHURN ALERT: Customer A (health 3/10, 80% churn risk). Annual value: $120K. Renewal: 2 weeks. Recommended action: Executive outreach + QBR + use-case review"
   - CSM assigned to Customer A: "Customer A showing warning signs (declining usage, support friction). Let's schedule QBR this week. Use template [link] to discuss new use cases."
   - Sorensen: "Customer expansion opportunity: Customer B (new dept adoption). Recommended upsell size: $40K. CSM ready for conversation."

3. **Monday 10am**: CSM intervention
   - Scheduled QBR with Customer A addressing stated concerns (not generic conversation)
   - Engaged Sorensen + product team to discuss roadmap alignment with customer's upcoming initiatives
   - Customer reveals budget constraint due to internal reorganization → payment plan solution proposed

4. **Wednesday**: Expansion conversation with Customer B
   - CSM + AE discusses new department rollout opportunity
   - Claude has pre-loaded recommended use cases based on Customer B's stated business priorities
   - $40K expansion deal moved to pipeline

#### Monthly Outcome
- **Churn Prevention**: Customer A intervention → renewed (vs. lost)
- **Revenue Protected**: $120K annual revenue retained that would have been lost
- **Expansion**: Customer B upsell → $40K added to pipeline (vs. missed)
- **CSM Efficiency**: 5 hours manual analysis/week eliminated; time freed for relationship building
- **Total Monthly Impact**: **$13K revenue protected/expansion (annualized: $160K)**

### Month 3: Marketing Campaign Velocity & Sales Enablement

#### Scenario: Demand Generation Campaign Launch (End of Month)
**Today's Reality** (Marketing team: 1 week to launch campaign):
- Marketing writes email copy → Designer's queue (3-day wait) → Design assets → Client review → Revisions
- Sales enabled with generic deck → reps customize for 3-4 hours per major opportunity
- Result: Campaign launches 1 week late; sales materials not prospect-specific

**With Claude + Canva MCP** (1-day campaign launch):
1. **Monday Morning**: Campaign brief created
   - Target: CFOs at mid-market tech companies considering cloud migration
   - Key message: ROI through resource optimization
   - Creative: Contrast current complexity vs. simplified post-implementation

2. **Monday 10am**: Claude generates campaign
   - Email sequence (5-email cadence with progressive narrative)
   - Landing page copy with CFO-specific value prop
   - Visual creative direction (CFO perspective: dashboard/simplification vs. complexity)
   - LinkedIn carousel concepts (3 variations testing different value props)
   - Sales talking points (objection handling, ROI calculator concepts)

3. **Monday 2pm**: Canva MCP auto-creates visual assets
   - Email header graphics (5 variations)
   - Landing page hero section (2 design options)
   - LinkedIn carousel slides (3 variations × 5 slides each)
   - Social media graphics (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram formats)

4. **Monday 5pm**: Sales Enablement
   - Claude generates custom pitch deck based on campaign messaging
   - 10 sales reps each input "customer profile" (company, industry, known priorities)
   - Canva MCP auto-generates 10 custom decks (each with company logo, industry-specific ROI, relevant case study)
   - Reps spend 15 minutes reviewing custom deck vs. 3-4 hours customizing generic deck

5. **Tuesday morning**: Campaign Live
   - Email sent to 5K prospect list
   - Sales team armed with custom decks for outbound

#### Campaign Outcomes
- **Velocity**: 1 week → 1 day (7x faster campaign launch)
- **Sales Effectiveness**: Custom decks improve qualification, reduce proposal turnaround
- **Email Performance**: Persona-specific messaging improves click-through rate 18% vs. generic campaigns
- **Content Reuse**: Campaign assets repurposed for social media, webinars, sales collateral (5 additional campaigns worth of content)

#### Monthly Campaign Impact
- 5K prospects reached (vs. 3K if campaign delayed 1 week)
- 18% CTR improvement vs. 8% baseline = 900 additional clicks → 45 additional MQLs (assuming 5% conversion)
- Assuming 15% MQL-to-SQL conversion = 6-7 additional SQOs
- Assuming 25% win rate = 1-2 additional deals (conservative, multi-month sales cycles)
- Average deal size $100K: **1-2 deals = $100K-200K incremental annual pipeline**

## VI. Risk Mitigation & Success Factors

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Sorensen's Active Participation**: Use case success depends on VP Sales/Marketing/CS actively adopting Claude tools from Week 1
2. **Data Quality**: HubSpot must be "clean" (deal structure consistent, activities logged, customer data mapped); otherwise forecast/health scoring ineffective
3. **Team Training**: Sales/marketing/CS team needs 1-2 hour training to understand Claude recommendations vs. treating as gospel
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Forecast/health models improve by 20-30% over first 8 weeks; measure continuously and adjust

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| HubSpot data incomplete | Medium | Forecast/health scoring unreliable | Audit data in Week 1; establish data governance |
| Team doesn't adopt Claude insights | Medium | No behavior change, no revenue impact | Start with Sorensen as early adopter; showcase quick wins |
| Forecast misses | Low (after Week 4) | Board loses confidence | Position as advisor with ±8% band; emphasize human override capability |
| Sales team resists "coaching" | Low | Coaching ignored, no deal improvement | Frame as best-practice guidance, not directive; tie to top performers |

---

## XI. Conclusion: From Reactive to Predictive Revenue Operations

Ty Sorensen currently leads revenue operations that are reactive: analyzing historical data, responding to surprises, optimizing resources after the fact. Claude transforms this to predictive: forecasting accurately, identifying risks before they materialize, recognizing opportunities proactively.

The opportunity is clear: $1.2M-2M in incremental annual revenue, 60-70% efficiency gains across the team, and board-level confidence in forecast accuracy.

The investment is modest: $25K-35K Year 1.

The timeline is short: 30-day pilot to prove the model.

The question for Sorensen: **When do we start?**
