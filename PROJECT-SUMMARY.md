## Risk Register and Mitigation

### High-Priority Risks

**Risk 1: Executive Adoption Resistance**
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (POC fails if executives don't use it)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with early adopters (CTO likely most tech-savvy)
  - Show immediate value in first session (board prep automation)
  - Provide dedicated support during first 2 weeks
  - Track usage and intervene proactively if adoption lags

**Risk 2: Technical Integration Complexity**
- **Likelihood:** Medium-High
- **Impact:** Medium (delays rollout, reduces value)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with Filesystem MCP (zero dependencies, immediate value)
  - Phase in complex MCPs (Asana, HubSpot) after basics working
  - Have technical support on-call during rollout
  - Prepare fallback workflows (manual data input if MCP fails)

**Risk 3: ROI Not Realized**
- **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
- **Impact:** High (credibility loss, project cancellation)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Conservative projections (already 50% below theoretical maximum)
  - Early measurement and course-correction
  - Focus on demonstrable wins (board prep, code review) first
  - Document time savings rigorously (before/after time studies)

**Risk 4: Security or Compliance Incident**
- **Likelihood:** Low
- **Impact:** Critical (immediate project shutdown)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use Claude Enterprise (SOC 2 Type II, zero data retention)
  - Strict access controls (role-based permissions)
  - Complete audit trail of all AI interactions
  - Regular security reviews and monitoring
  - Data classification policy (no PII/confidential data without approval)

### Medium-Priority Risks

**Risk 5: Board Presentation Demo Failure**
- **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (credibility damage, delayed approval)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test demos 3x before board presentation
  - Prepare backup: Pre-recorded videos
  - Have fallback: Show static outputs if live demo fails
  - Practice run with friendly audience first

**Risk 6: Competing Priorities**
- **Likelihood:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (delays implementation, reduces engagement)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Executive sponsor commitment (CEO/COO endorsement)
  - Schedule dedicated onboarding time (non-negotiable)
  - Show quick wins to maintain momentum
  - Integrate into existing workflows (don't add new processes)

---

## Key Lessons and Best Practices

### What Worked Well

**1. ISPN-Specific Customization**
- Using actual ISPN systems (Asana, HubSpot, Salesforce) made use cases immediately credible
- Real workflow examples (7-day close, ±18% forecast variance) resonated strongly
- Specific dollar amounts ($12.5M AR, $2.5M initiative budget) added authenticity

**2. Conservative ROI Methodology**
- Bottom-of-range estimates (not aspirational targets) built trust
- Detailed calculation methodology (hourly rates, time studies) provided defensibility
- Multiple validation approaches (time savings, productivity gains, risk reduction) strengthened case

**3. Zero Jargon Approach**
- Eliminating AI terminology made materials accessible to non-technical executives
- Business language focus (automation, analysis, intelligence) kept conversation strategic
- Outcome-oriented descriptions (faster, more accurate, proactive) emphasized value over technology

**4. Demonstration-First Design**
- Every use case designed for 5-minute live demo ensured practical viability
- Demo scripts provided clear step-by-step implementation guidance
- Sample data preparation ensured demos work reliably

### What to Watch For

**1. Executive Time Commitment**
- Initial setup requires 2-3 hours per executive (onboarding, configuration)
- Learning curve: 1-2 weeks to become proficient with prompts and workflows
- Ongoing optimization: 30-60 minutes weekly to refine workflows

**2. Technical Dependencies**
- MCP configuration can be complex (especially HubSpot, Asana integrations)
- Data quality issues can impact Claude's analysis quality
- Network connectivity required (cloud-based MCPs need reliable internet)

**3. Change Management**
- Some executives may resist changing established workflows
- Team members may feel threatened by automation
- Cultural shift required: From manual data gathering to strategic analysis

**4. Realistic Timeline Expectations**
- Full value realization takes 2-3 months (not immediate)
- Phase 1 delivers 25-30% of projected value (quick wins)
- Phase 2-3 unlocks remaining 70-75% (optimization and adoption)
